# Money Child

## A productivity app to help with chores

MoneyChild is an Android mobile app that helps parents motivate their children to do the chores around the house, like wiping the dust or washing the dishes.

Only the parent has to download the app on his/her phone, so that he/she can easily send a list of certain chores to the child via email.

While creating a chore for the child, the parent has to set a reward in cash for a job well done. If the chore is not done, then the child doesn’t receive any rewards.

The project uses Kotlin. The app is made of 3 pages, a "Children" page, a "Chores" page and a "Send" page.

In the “Children” page, the parent can add their kids to this list so that they can sort the available chores among them. Each child must have an email address of his own, so that each kid will receive the chores that he/she must complete.

The “Chores” page, the parent can add chores by writing a title and a description of the chore that the kid has to do and the reward that he will receive after the job is complete.

In the “Send” page, the parent can send the chores via email to their children.

The chores and the children that must complete them will be saved in a SQL database.
